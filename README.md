# HP-Products-Knowledge-Graph-Visualizing-Customer-Sentiments

HP Printer Sentiment Analysis

I am thrilled to present my winning project in the prestigious nationwide hackathon HP Solve 2.0 2023, where I secured the 5th position out of 500+ teams. This project aims to help HP, a leading product company, understand customer sentiments about their products, using cutting-edge sentiment analysis techniques.

Data Collection Efforts:
The journey began with diligent data collection efforts, where I scraped customer reviews and feedback from various platforms, including e-commerce websites, forums, and social media. This meticulous data collection resulted in a rich dataset comprising around 8000 rows, encompassing diverse opinions and experiences of customers with different HP printer models.

Dataset Preprocessing:
To ensure the dataset's quality and usability, extensive preprocessing was performed, including handling missing values, special characters, and standardizing the text data. The cleaned and prepared dataset provided a robust foundation for subsequent analysis.

Text Classification and Sentiment Analysis:
The heart of this project lies in text classification and sentiment analysis. I employed advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, including TF-IDF vectorization and logistic regression, to classify customer reviews into sentiments such as appreciation, complaint, and suggestion.

Knowledge Graph Visualization:
Another exciting aspect of the project is the creation of a knowledge graph using NetworkX. The graph beautifully represents the relationships between printer models, problems, and factors, helping HP quickly identify key insights and areas for improvement.
